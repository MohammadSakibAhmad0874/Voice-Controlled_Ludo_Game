## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Voice Recognition Not Working
- **Check microphone permissions** in browser settings
- **Ensure microphone is connected** and working
- **Try refreshing the page** and granting permissions again
- **Check browser compatibility** (Chrome works best)

#### No Voice Feedback
- **Check speaker/headphone volume**
- **Ensure browser audio is not muted**
- **Try different browser** if speech synthesis fails

#### Game Not Loading
- **Check JavaScript console** for errors (F12)
- **Ensure JavaScript is enabled** in browser
- **Try different browser** or incognito mode
- **Check internet connection** for initial load

#### Commands Not Recognized
- **Speak clearly** and at normal pace
- **Use exact command phrases** as listed
- **Check microphone sensitivity** in system settings
- **Reduce background noise**

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Reduce animation complexity for slower devices
.piece {
    transition: transform 0.1s ease; /* Faster transitions */
}

// Disable continuous listening for better performance
this.recognition.continuous = false;
```
